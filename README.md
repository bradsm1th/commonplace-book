# Commonplace Book 
This is a simple "commonplace book". Though the [general idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) of "keeping important quotes for later" has been around for hundreds of years, I did not start keeping my own until learning of them from [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/). 

This version (V1) is simply a list of quotes you'd like to save. Alongside standard features like creating, editing, and deleting quotes, I've also included the option to add some metadata (what I call *context*):
- **Where.** Where you were when you decided to capture this.
- **Why.** What made you think this was worth saving.

If you jot these things down, either immediately or soon after, your recollection will be even stronger!
